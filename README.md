# SES-Python
scans an image for the first face it detects and mirrors it vertically

To install all the necessary requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the program a file named ```sample.jpg``` must be placed in the same directory as the script.
The script can then be executed and will generate a file named "sample_SES.py" with the mirrored face.
